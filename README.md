# Camera Trap Image Classifier
Automatically identify animals in camera trap images by training and applying a deep neural network.

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation to train and apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying animal species in photographs from camera traps.

## Pre-Requisites

To use this code following pre-requisites must be met:

1. Camera trap images (jpeg / jpg) with labels
2. Access to computer/server with graphics processing units (GPUs) for model training (e.g. AWS account)
3. Some (little) knowledge of Unix
